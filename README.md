Online Food Delivery System

The purpose of the "ONLINE FOOD DELIVERY SYSTEM" project is to create a digital platform that simplifies the process of ordering and delivering food from local restaurants 
to the customer's doorsteps. 
The project aims to leverage technology to make food delivery more convenient, efficient, and user-friendly.

In our project, various tools and technologies are used for both the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) development. Here's a list of tools involved:
# Frontend (Client-Side):
1. HTML (HyperText Markup Language): Used for structuring the content of the webpage.
2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Used for styling and formatting the appearance of the webpage.
3. Bootstrap: A CSS framework used for responsive and mobile-first web development. It provides pre-designed components and styles.
4. JavaScript: Used for adding dynamic behavior to the webpage, such as handling events and modifying the DOM (Document Object Model).
5. jQuery: A JavaScript library that simplifies DOM manipulation, event handling, and animation.

# Backend (Server-Side):
1. PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor):A server-side scripting language used for handling server-side logic, interacting with databases, and generating dynamic content.
2. MySQL: A relational database management system (RDBMS) used for storing and retrieving data. In this code, it's likely used to interact with a MySQL database.

# Git:
Version control systems like Git are often used for tracking changes in code, collaborating with others and managing project versions.
